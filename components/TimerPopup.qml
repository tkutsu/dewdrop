    // second. Qt only works out which item is under the pointer when the
    // pointer moves, so after each rebuild the hover was left on whichever item
    // had inherited that position: pointing at the first row lit the third, and
    // the middle rows lit nothing at all. A click would have gone the same way,
    // which is a timer cancelled that nobody aimed at.
