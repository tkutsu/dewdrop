// How bright the screen is behind a box of frost, for Theme.frostOver.
//
// The frost is a thin dark fill over the compositor's blur (Theme.popupBg), and
// one alpha cannot do both jobs: thin enough to be glass over a dark terminal
// is a light grey over a white page, with white text on it. A box asks this
// what it is over and thickens its frost to match.
//
// Read from one still of the screen, taken as the box comes up. A box whose
// first frame is not on screen yet by then is read exactly: what is under it.
// One that is (ringOnly) is read by the ring round it, below. Read at a sixteenth of the size, which is the
// blur's scale anyway and next to nothing to walk, and let go once read.
//
// Read again once a workspace switched under an open box has slid into place.
// The box is in that still, so that reading takes the ring round the box and
// its shadow instead: 64px of whatever is next to it, the nearest guess there
// is at what is under it.
