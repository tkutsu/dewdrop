// What hangs off a bar item, for the modules and the individual tray icons:
// its tooltip, on hover, or the popup a click opened.
//
// Tooltips follow the Mac's help tags. The first one waits for the pointer to
// rest a moment, since it is there for a hesitation rather than a pass over
// the bar; once one is up the next shows as soon as it is reached (Tooltips).
// Leaving closes it at once, a click puts it away until the pointer has left,
// and none shows while a popup is open, just as none does while a menu is
// down from the menu bar.
