// One connection to mpd that comes back on its own, for services/Mpd.qml,
// which keeps two of them (one parked in `idle`, one for commands).
//
// The connection is rebuilt rather than re-dialled. A Socket whose *first*
// connect fails is dead for good in Quickshell 0.3.1: `connected` never
// changes, so nothing hears about the failure, and neither assigning
// `connected = true` again nor reassigning `path` makes it try a second time
// — measured against this build, not assumed. A drop from a connection that
// did come up does re-dial, but the two arrive together whenever mpd is
// stopped rather than merely absent, so both go the same way: throw the
// object away and build another.
//
// `connected` is read off the socket rather than set by its signal: a fresh
// socket is already open by the time a handler on it would be attached, so
// the first change never arrives. Reading through the Loader's `item`, which
// is set once the socket is finished, is what turns that into a change.
