// mark's glass, made solid (Theme.badgeBg) over its own pill, with a white number. It grows into a pill rather than staying round, because "20" and "99"
// have to fit the same badge a "2" does.
//
// The disc is opaque unless its owner says otherwise. It spends half its area
// over the icon's own white strokes, and anything it let through came up under
// the digit and ate into its contrast.
//
// The count rolls to its next value the way the timer's figures do
// (RollingText): up when it grows, down when it shrinks.
