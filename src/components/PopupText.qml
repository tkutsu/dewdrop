// face, at the tooltip size style.css gave them. Anything that differs — mono
// figures, a bold header, a dimmed line — says only what differs.
//
// Weight is deliberately left alone. The popups all asked for Font.Normal by
// name, which is Text's own default, and a weight set here would be a second
// opinion for `font.bold` to argue with in the few places that want one.
