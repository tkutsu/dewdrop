// connecting, a network being joined. A quarter-open ring turning, in the
// label colour, the size of the text beside it.
//
// It only turns while it is visible. A running animation redraws the popup at
// the monitor's rate, which is fine for the seconds a connection takes and
// not for a spinner that was merely hidden.
