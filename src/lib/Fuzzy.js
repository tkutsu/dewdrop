// fzf-v1-style fuzzy scorer, standing in for rofi's `matching: "normal"` plus
// `tokenize: true`. Returns a number (higher = better) or null when the query
// is not a subsequence of the text.
//
// Callers score one term against several fields and keep the best, so the
// numbers here only ever have to be comparable with each other.

// rofi ran with `normalize-match: true`, which matches accented text from an
// unaccented query. NFD splits a precomposed letter into its base plus a
// combining mark, and U+0300-U+036F is the block those marks live in, so
// dropping them leaves the base letter: "Téléchargé" becomes "Telecharge" and
// "Καφές" becomes "Καφες".
//
// Deliberately not \p{Diacritic}: the explicit range says which marks are
// meant, and does not lean on a regex feature Qt's JS engine only recently
// grew.

// Folding is the expensive half of a score: normalize() builds a new string
// and the regex walks it, and this used to pay for it on the text and on the
// query alike, once per call. Against a few hundred app names that is nothing.
// Against ten thousand track titles, on every keystroke, it is the whole cost
// — measured over this machine's library at 7ms a term, against 1ms once the
// text has been folded in advance.
//

// does once, when the list is built; scorePrepped() is what it calls per
// keystroke.
