import Quickshell

// Where the shell keeps what it writes. Nothing else builds a path out of
// $HOME, so a file moves in one place.
//
// Three kinds of file, each in a quickshell/ of its own under the matching
// XDG base directory: state is what the shell remembers across restarts (the
// drawer's pins, the timers, the notifications), data is what it was handed
// and cannot make again (the Google sign-in), and cache is anything it can
// (wallpaper thumbnails). Not Quickshell.stateDir and friends: those are one
// level further down, per shell, and the files were here first.
//
// At the root for the same reason as Settings: components read it too.
