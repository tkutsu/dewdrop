// ~/_scripts/gtasks-setup walks the consent once and leaves a refresh token in
// the file read below, granted for every scope the bar uses; scripts/gtasks-auth
// is the consent step on its own, which the popups run to reconnect. Everything after
// that happens here: the refresh token is traded for an access token that lasts
// an hour, kept in memory and never written down — a copy on disk would only
// be a second thing able to go stale.
//
// What each service keeps for itself is what it fetches and what it makes of a
// failure. `send` hands a reply to `then` or a reason to `fail`, so no caller
// has to remember to check a status code. The shape of a service — polling,
// gathering, trouble — is GoogleService.qml, which these services build on.
