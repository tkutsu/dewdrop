// Remembers what components/InkProbe.qml found, so an icon is measured once
// rather than once per time it appears.
//
// The bar sees the same handful of icons over and over: nm-applet walks up and
// down its signal strengths, Telegram swaps between quiet and attention, and a
// tray rebuild hands every delegate its icon again from scratch. Measuring
// costs a frame's worth of work — a grab off the GPU and a read back down — and
// none of it is worth paying twice for an answer that cannot have changed.

    // actually shown, so it stays the size of a tray rather than of a theme.

    // on their way past, so a binding that asked before the answer arrived is
    // re-run once it has.

    // with a measurement that has not landed: draw at the asked size.

    // read as "the whole box".
