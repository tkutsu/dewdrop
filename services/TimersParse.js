// Reading what was typed into a timer, for services/Timers.qml.
//
// One grammar for the IPC call and the prompt box, because they are the same
// act: "25m", "1h30", "7:30 wake up". What is not a duration and not a time
// of day is not a timer, and says so rather than guessing. Pure functions of
// their input, which is why they live here and not in the singleton: nothing
// in them reads the list or the clock.

// What can be written here, for the grey line under the launcher's query.
// Forms, not sentences: the label is whatever you write after the time and
// needs no example. These are the shapes the time itself can take, which is
// the part that has to be remembered rather than guessed.
